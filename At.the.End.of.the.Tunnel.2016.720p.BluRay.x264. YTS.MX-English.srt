1
00:01:28,839 --> 00:01:30,007
<i>Mommy!</i>

2
00:01:30,174 --> 00:01:32,593
AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL

3
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:33,803
<i>Mommy!</i>

4
00:01:33,969 --> 00:01:36,514
<i>- What?
- I'm with Casimiro!</i>

5
00:01:45,189 --> 00:01:47,108
<i>Lunch is ready!</i>

6
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:50,069
<i>I'm on the slide!</i>

7
00:02:05,584 --> 00:02:07,503
<i>I like Mathematics.</i>

8
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:09,255
<i>You'll have to work hard.</i>

9
00:02:09,421 --> 00:02:12,299
<i>If I do it wrong,
PH get a zero.</i>

10
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:14,677
<i>No, you won't get a zero.</i>

11
00:02:17,555 --> 00:02:18,889
<i>Sweetie, time for bed.</i>

12
00:02:19,056 --> 00:02:21,392
<i>Wait, let me tuck in Casimiro.</i>

13
00:02:21,559 --> 00:02:24,061
<i>Come on, go to bed.
It's late, sweetheart.</i>

14
00:03:43,849 --> 00:03:45,392
Pick up, damn it!

15
00:03:47,102 --> 00:03:50,606
Yes, I'm calling for Casimiro's
test results.

16
00:03:51,482 --> 00:03:52,608
Joaquin.

17
00:03:53,609 --> 00:03:58,197
No, my name is Joaquin.
Casimiro is my dog.

18
00:03:59,073 --> 00:04:02,618
Yeah, he's very old.
He doesn't want to walk anymore.

19
00:04:05,329 --> 00:04:09,208
Well, is there any type
of treatment

20
00:04:09,375 --> 00:04:11,669
or operation that can be done?

21
00:04:14,255 --> 00:04:15,673
But it wouldn't solve anything.

22
00:04:17,841 --> 00:04:21,053
Okay, thank you.
I'm going to think about it.

23
00:04:26,725 --> 00:04:29,061
HOW TO PUT A DOG TO SLEEP
WITHOUT PAIN

24
00:05:03,887 --> 00:05:05,472
- Hi.
- Hi.

25
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:07,016
Did you put an ad
renting

26
00:05:07,182 --> 00:05:08,350
a room with a terrace?

27
00:05:08,767 --> 00:05:10,311
Can we see it?

28
00:05:11,061 --> 00:05:13,772
Yes, but you should have called
before coming.

29
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:15,774
Come on, Betty.

30
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:22,448
It's up there.

31
00:05:23,907 --> 00:05:25,784
- How cute! What's its name?
- Casimiro.

32
00:05:25,951 --> 00:05:26,660
Don't touch him!

33
00:05:26,827 --> 00:05:29,580
He doesn't like people
he doesn't know.

34
00:05:30,164 --> 00:05:31,623
Do you live alone?

35
00:05:32,082 --> 00:05:33,042
Yes.

36
00:05:34,793 --> 00:05:38,255
I don't think this is what
you're looking for.

37
00:05:39,214 --> 00:05:40,424
It's not the ideal place...

38
00:05:40,591 --> 00:05:42,384
How do you know
what I'm looking for?

39
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:45,387
- Go up and look at it.
- Okay.

40
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:49,516
The door to the terrace
is next to the bathroom door.

41
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:51,226
Okay.

42
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:15,459
Can we move in today?

43
00:06:16,502 --> 00:06:17,294
What?

44
00:06:17,461 --> 00:06:20,339
My stuff is nearby,
I can bring it right over.

45
00:06:20,506 --> 00:06:21,840
You'd be saving us
if you say yes.

46
00:06:22,007 --> 00:06:24,635
- No, no...
- Here's what we'll do.

47
00:06:24,802 --> 00:06:26,929
Don't say anything.
We'll be back in half an hour.

48
00:06:27,096 --> 00:06:29,681
- Call me first.
- Don't show it to anyone.

49
00:06:29,848 --> 00:06:30,891
Please, call me first.

50
00:06:31,058 --> 00:06:32,434
- Half an hour.
- Thanks.

51
00:06:33,268 --> 00:06:34,395
Thanks!

52
00:06:47,282 --> 00:06:48,826
Come in, come in.

53
00:06:49,201 --> 00:06:50,494
Thanks.

54
00:07:14,935 --> 00:07:16,019
This one?

55
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:19,148
There.

56
00:07:20,816 --> 00:07:22,776
Shouldn't it go over here?

57
00:07:23,694 --> 00:07:25,154
Just asking.

58
00:07:27,406 --> 00:07:30,409
I don't need company.

59
00:07:30,993 --> 00:07:34,079
That's not why I rented the room,
to have someone organizing

60
00:07:34,246 --> 00:07:35,664
and cleaning the house.

61
00:07:35,831 --> 00:07:37,040
What bullshit.

62
00:07:47,593 --> 00:07:50,012
What are these marks
on the door?

63
00:07:52,347 --> 00:07:53,432
The marks...

64
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,476
When you're growing,
as you get taller...

65
00:08:03,734 --> 00:08:06,653
How many lighters
do you use a day?

66
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:09,198
I'm only thinking of Betty...

67
00:08:11,533 --> 00:08:14,119
Betty, the little girl
who's always with me.

68
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:19,458
Since you asked, I'll tell you.
I'm a dancer.

69
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:22,753
That's what I do.
I dance in a club.

70
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,171
I'm a stripper.

71
00:08:24,338 --> 00:08:25,422
But not the kind you're thinking.

72
00:08:25,714 --> 00:08:27,257
That wouldn't be my problem.

73
00:08:40,771 --> 00:08:42,648
FORECLOSURE
FINAL NOTICE

74
00:09:00,582 --> 00:09:03,669
Can you turn down the music
a little, please?

75
00:09:07,422 --> 00:09:08,298
Excuse me.

76
00:09:09,091 --> 00:09:10,717
Have you seen my daughter?

77
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:11,843
No.

78
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:14,471
- Could she have gone back there?
- No.

79
00:09:14,638 --> 00:09:16,223
She couldn't have gone
back there.

80
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:17,516
Don't go back there.

81
00:09:17,683 --> 00:09:20,310
She could have walked right by you
and you didn't see her.

82
00:09:20,477 --> 00:09:21,603
Damn it. Betty!

83
00:09:25,941 --> 00:09:27,693
Sweetie, are you out here?

84
00:09:27,985 --> 00:09:29,152
Betty!

85
00:09:34,825 --> 00:09:36,159
Betty!

86
00:09:40,706 --> 00:09:42,291
Are you here?

87
00:10:00,267 --> 00:10:01,643
Betty!

88
00:10:06,106 --> 00:10:07,608
Betty!

89
00:10:10,027 --> 00:10:12,154
She likes to hide,
I don't know why.

90
00:10:12,321 --> 00:10:13,864
She suddenly disappears.

91
00:10:14,031 --> 00:10:16,408
That's locked, she couldn't have
gone in there.

92
00:10:16,575 --> 00:10:19,244
- Did you check the bedroom?
- Yes, I did.

93
00:10:19,411 --> 00:10:20,662
Betty!

94
00:10:21,872 --> 00:10:23,081
Betty!

95
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:31,506
Sweetheart!

96
00:10:32,257 --> 00:10:33,258
Come here.

97
00:10:33,759 --> 00:10:36,261
Hide in easier places to find!

98
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:38,680
Here, let me see your pockets.

99
00:10:39,931 --> 00:10:42,267
I'll put this back where it goes.

100
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:45,997
Hey, how long has it been
since you saw the terrace?

101
00:11:46,873 --> 00:11:48,709
You know what's out there?

102
00:11:49,334 --> 00:11:50,877
Obviously not.

103
00:11:52,087 --> 00:11:55,048
I can't describe it.
You have to come up and see it.

104
00:11:55,507 --> 00:11:58,051
Yeah, I'd love to go skating too.

105
00:11:59,511 --> 00:12:00,637
Come on.

106
00:12:13,108 --> 00:12:15,318
In the contract
you made me sign...

107
00:12:16,027 --> 00:12:20,115
I saw that today happens to be
your birthday.

108
00:12:28,331 --> 00:12:30,625
You don't like kids?

109
00:12:31,543 --> 00:12:33,336
You don't talk to her,
you barely look at her...

110
00:12:33,503 --> 00:12:35,046
She doesn't talk to me
either.

111
00:12:35,213 --> 00:12:37,799
She doesn't talk to anyone,
not even me.

112
00:12:38,091 --> 00:12:39,134
She's not mute.

113
00:12:39,301 --> 00:12:41,303
She just stopped talking.

114
00:12:42,554 --> 00:12:45,307
The psychologist said it was better
not to pressure her.

115
00:12:48,059 --> 00:12:50,228
Who do you spend
Christmas and New Year's with?

116
00:12:50,395 --> 00:12:51,313
With Casimiro.

117
00:12:52,606 --> 00:12:54,065
That's great.

118
00:12:54,232 --> 00:12:56,276
There will be 4 of us now.

119
00:12:59,404 --> 00:13:00,614
Were you always like this?

120
00:13:01,323 --> 00:13:03,116
Like what?

121
00:13:07,746 --> 00:13:10,665
Shall I take her to bed
and open another bottle?

122
00:13:12,209 --> 00:13:13,752
Come on, sweetie.

123
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:14,961
Let's go.

124
00:13:27,098 --> 00:13:29,142
I like to dance, but really dance.

125
00:13:29,684 --> 00:13:30,894
You know?

126
00:13:31,102 --> 00:13:33,021
I studied dance.

127
00:13:33,688 --> 00:13:36,900
After that, I came to Buenos Aires,
and...

128
00:13:43,448 --> 00:13:46,117
My old man's house
was full of books too.

129
00:13:47,244 --> 00:13:49,204
There were books everywhere.

130
00:13:52,082 --> 00:13:53,917
You don't care at all,
do you?

131
00:13:54,292 --> 00:13:55,627
I'm listening.

132
00:13:55,794 --> 00:13:59,339
If all you need is money,
why don't you sell this huge house?

133
00:14:01,883 --> 00:14:03,760
This is my home.

134
00:14:04,219 --> 00:14:07,138
Yeah, but this house
must be worth 600,000 dollars.

135
00:14:07,347 --> 00:14:08,223
At least.

136
00:14:11,768 --> 00:14:15,146
What a shitty birthday.

137
00:14:15,814 --> 00:14:18,024
I wish I could dance, but...

138
00:14:23,238 --> 00:14:24,281
Okay.

139
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:29,411
What are you doing?

140
00:14:29,703 --> 00:14:31,413
It's what I do best.

141
00:14:32,789 --> 00:14:33,832
Here?

142
00:14:33,999 --> 00:14:35,917
Tomorrow we'll just say
it was the booze.

143
00:14:36,084 --> 00:14:37,752
But no laughing

144
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:39,504
or teasing me about it.

145
00:16:42,752 --> 00:16:44,671
No, Joaquin said not to!

146
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:47,424
Betty, that's enough!
I won't say it again!

147
00:19:34,174 --> 00:19:35,925
<i>Tell those two to stop
in there.</i>

148
00:19:38,887 --> 00:19:40,763
<i>I heard something
at the cripple's place.</i>

149
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:42,265
<i>I didn't hear shit.</i>

150
00:19:42,432 --> 00:19:45,643
<i>I said I heard something,
you dumbshit.</i>

151
00:19:47,061 --> 00:19:48,897
<i>It was the elevator.
Lefty, should I take this?</i>

152
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:51,399
<i>Let me listen.
Keep quiet.</i>

153
00:19:53,151 --> 00:19:55,445
<i>We should have plastered
on this wall.</i>

154
00:20:01,826 --> 00:20:03,036
<i>I don't hear anything.</i>

155
00:20:03,995 --> 00:20:05,496
<i>Tell those two come out.</i>

156
00:20:05,663 --> 00:20:06,998
<i>Stay here and listen.</i>

157
00:20:11,169 --> 00:20:13,004
<i>Let's all go back up.</i>

158
00:20:19,385 --> 00:20:21,221
What are you doing?
Come up here!

159
00:20:22,472 --> 00:20:25,225
Don't miss this!
Your dog mummy woke up!

160
00:20:25,683 --> 00:20:27,518
Don't be so insensitive!

161
00:20:27,685 --> 00:20:29,646
- Come up here!
- I'm coming.

162
00:20:30,897 --> 00:20:31,731
Come up!

163
00:21:07,809 --> 00:21:08,810
He got up.

164
00:21:09,143 --> 00:21:10,603
And he stood there
for a while.

165
00:21:12,188 --> 00:21:13,856
Aren't you happy?

166
00:21:14,023 --> 00:21:15,900
Yeah, can't you tell?

167
00:21:16,401 --> 00:21:18,778
Is something wrong?
You look like shit.

168
00:21:19,612 --> 00:21:21,948
No, I'm fine.
What is this?

169
00:21:22,115 --> 00:21:25,451
This is that I'm not going
to let you keep working.

170
00:21:25,618 --> 00:21:29,038
We'll cook and eat together
to celebrate Casimiro's revival.

171
00:21:29,247 --> 00:21:34,043
I might not do a striptease
for you tonight...

172
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:24,886
<i>I heard the cripple's elevator
10 minutes ago.</i>

173
00:22:25,053 --> 00:22:25,887
<i>What do we do?</i>

174
00:22:26,054 --> 00:22:28,973
<i>I checked, we're good.
Let's keep going.</i>

175
00:22:39,901 --> 00:22:41,152
<i>Come on,
we need to hurry up.</i>

176
00:22:41,319 --> 00:22:43,112
<i>How are things going in there,
Puppet?</i>

177
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:44,864
<i>- Hot but okay.
- Puppet?</i>

178
00:22:45,907 --> 00:22:47,325
PUPPET

179
00:22:47,492 --> 00:22:50,495
<i>- What am I, your servant?
- Why are you asking about the heat?</i>

180
00:22:50,661 --> 00:22:52,455
<i>- Pichi, Pichi.
- What?</i>

181
00:22:52,622 --> 00:22:54,832
<i>- Put that over there.
- Yes, sir, but...</i>

182
00:22:54,999 --> 00:22:56,751
<i>We have to be more careful,
Papito.</i>

183
00:22:56,918 --> 00:22:58,586
<i>Keep going,
quit screwing around.</i>

184
00:22:58,753 --> 00:23:01,547
<i>One... second,
let me... turn on... the light.</i>

185
00:23:01,714 --> 00:23:03,174
<i>How are we for 10 days?</i>

186
00:23:03,341 --> 00:23:04,801
<i>Okay, I think.</i>

187
00:23:10,098 --> 00:23:11,349
SATURDAY DECEMBER 24TH

188
00:23:11,516 --> 00:23:13,184
<i>These beams are no good.</i>

189
00:23:13,351 --> 00:23:14,769
<i>Take them upstairs,
they're in the way.</i>

190
00:23:15,478 --> 00:23:16,687
BEAMS?

191
00:23:16,896 --> 00:23:18,606
<i>Mr. Galereto,
should I take this up too?</i>

192
00:23:18,773 --> 00:23:19,899
<i>No, leave it for now.</i>

193
00:23:20,066 --> 00:23:21,359
<i>I'm going up to sleep
for a while.</i>

194
00:23:21,526 --> 00:23:23,111
<i>I'll tell René to come down.</i>

195
00:23:23,277 --> 00:23:25,446
<i>Canario, I'm taking this
to the table.</i>

196
00:23:25,613 --> 00:23:27,407
<i>Whose glass is this?</i>

197
00:23:29,075 --> 00:23:30,827
<i>Pass it over here.</i>

198
00:23:32,078 --> 00:23:33,371
<i>Should we stop at 6?</i>

199
00:23:33,538 --> 00:23:35,706
<i>Yeah, we'll see how it was.</i>

200
00:24:23,713 --> 00:24:25,798
You can't do this to me now.

201
00:24:26,174 --> 00:24:28,551
We signed a contract,
you asked me a ton of questions.

202
00:24:28,718 --> 00:24:30,094
We did sign a contract.

203
00:24:30,261 --> 00:24:32,180
You don't trust me?
ls there a reason?

204
00:24:32,346 --> 00:24:37,185
It has nothing to do with trust.
I just need a couple of weeks...

205
00:24:37,351 --> 00:24:39,270
Why do we have to find
somewhere else right away?

206
00:24:39,437 --> 00:24:41,647
I can't explain why, okay?

207
00:24:41,814 --> 00:24:44,358
- Just give me a few days...
-l'll explain it.

208
00:24:45,401 --> 00:24:47,820
You're scared because
we're getting closer.

209
00:24:47,987 --> 00:24:50,406
Because the other night...
I danced for you.

210
00:24:51,657 --> 00:24:53,409
That has nothing to do with it.

211
00:24:53,993 --> 00:24:55,786
I saw how you look at me.

212
00:24:56,412 --> 00:24:59,248
And you think less of yourself
because of that wheelchair.

213
00:24:59,415 --> 00:25:01,417
You were comfortable
by yourself

214
00:25:01,584 --> 00:25:03,711
and you're scared of losing that.

215
00:25:05,171 --> 00:25:07,215
You're smart, Joaquin
and good-looking

216
00:25:07,381 --> 00:25:10,718
but your life is awful and you
want to keep it that way.

217
00:25:13,554 --> 00:25:15,431
I know you like me.

218
00:25:16,766 --> 00:25:19,685
And you have no idea what I'm
going through and that scares you.

219
00:25:23,648 --> 00:25:25,024
Think it over.

220
00:25:25,191 --> 00:25:27,818
Tomorrow you can tell me
if you want us to leave.

221
00:25:27,985 --> 00:25:30,613
But give it one more day,
please.

222
00:25:41,624 --> 00:25:46,087
THEY WORK ONLY AT NIGHT

223
00:25:52,635 --> 00:25:55,888
THEY CARRY DIRT UPSTAIRS IN BAGS

224
00:26:00,643 --> 00:26:03,437
WHAT ARE THE BEAMS FOR?

225
00:26:18,035 --> 00:26:19,078
Hi.

226
00:26:19,495 --> 00:26:20,830
Good morning.

227
00:26:21,956 --> 00:26:22,915
Want some coffee?

228
00:26:23,082 --> 00:26:24,083
Yeah.

229
00:26:28,629 --> 00:26:29,922
Thanks.

230
00:26:32,675 --> 00:26:34,635
I'm going downstairs to work.

231
00:26:37,138 --> 00:26:38,639
I thought it over.

232
00:26:38,973 --> 00:26:41,726
And... I don't want you to leave.

233
00:26:43,436 --> 00:26:44,312
That's it.

234
00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:52,486
Come down when you can.

235
00:26:52,653 --> 00:26:55,406
I want to show you something
you won't believe.

236
00:27:11,922 --> 00:27:15,635
<i>Schwarzenegger, Schwarzenegger,
when can we eat something?</i>

237
00:27:16,052 --> 00:27:18,054
<i>You want to stop... and eat?</i>

238
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:20,514
<i>You're lazy even...
even with millions at stake.</i>

239
00:27:21,557 --> 00:27:24,226
<i>This heat is unbearable.
Can't we do something?</i>

240
00:27:24,393 --> 00:27:29,440
<i>Yeah, right. I'll install
some air conditioning later.</i>

241
00:27:45,206 --> 00:27:48,250
<i>It's not silly, according to
our natal charts, it's better to do it</i>

242
00:27:48,417 --> 00:27:50,086
<i>the 25th than the 24th.
I'm only asking for one more day.</i>

243
00:27:50,252 --> 00:27:53,923
<i>Know what the horoscope said about
1/12th of the passengers on the Titanic?</i>

244
00:27:54,090 --> 00:27:57,051
<i>"ldeal day for a trip."</i>

245
00:27:57,218 --> 00:27:59,053
<i>We should do it on the 25th,
not the 24th.</i>

246
00:27:59,261 --> 00:28:01,347
<i>- Trust me.
- Yeah, yeah.</i>

247
00:28:02,181 --> 00:28:04,141
<i>Lefty, show me.</i>

248
00:28:06,644 --> 00:28:08,938
<i>- I'm even trying to help...
- Look.</i>

249
00:28:09,146 --> 00:28:10,898
<i>Will it be strong enough?</i>

250
00:28:11,065 --> 00:28:12,274
<i>Yeah, I guess.</i>

251
00:28:12,441 --> 00:28:14,902
<i>I don't know how it works in Spain,
but don't say I guess.</i>

252
00:28:15,528 --> 00:28:17,154
<i>Don't worry, it'll be fine.</i>

253
00:28:18,906 --> 00:28:20,908
<i>Did you set the detonator,
Canario?</i>

254
00:28:21,075 --> 00:28:22,076
<i>Almost, almost.</i>

255
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:24,203
<i>But this is harder
than baptizing a cat.</i>

256
00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:26,956
<i>"Almost, almost."</i>

257
00:28:27,123 --> 00:28:29,208
<i>Galereto, you have a visitor.</i>

258
00:28:30,793 --> 00:28:33,963
<i>- What is she doing here?
- Should we leave you alone?</i>

259
00:28:36,549 --> 00:28:37,925
<i>What happened?</i>

260
00:28:38,509 --> 00:28:40,469
<i>I came over the terrace.</i>

261
00:28:40,845 --> 00:28:42,430
<i>Yeah, but what happened?</i>

262
00:28:42,596 --> 00:28:45,808
<i>He changed his mind.
He said to move out.</i>

263
00:28:52,189 --> 00:28:54,734
<i>- Did he go back down after 8'?
- No.</i>

264
00:28:55,025 --> 00:28:56,610
You're sure he can't hear
anything?

265
00:28:56,777 --> 00:28:59,488
He can't hear anything, Javi.
From anywhere.

266
00:29:00,698 --> 00:29:02,366
Keep stalling.

267
00:29:02,533 --> 00:29:06,120
Tell him you'll look
and can't find anything.

268
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:08,080
Keep him occupied.

269
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:11,333
Look what I got you.

270
00:29:13,836 --> 00:29:17,465
- Besides the crap you buy me...
- Crap?

271
00:29:17,631 --> 00:29:19,341
Stop groping me.

272
00:29:20,050 --> 00:29:22,178
You don't give a shit
what happens to me.

273
00:29:22,344 --> 00:29:24,430
You leave me with another guy

274
00:29:24,597 --> 00:29:26,474
-and you don't give a fuck.
- He's a cripple.

275
00:29:27,391 --> 00:29:30,936
<i>Or I wouldn't have gotten you into this.
You know Pm crazy about you.</i>

276
00:29:31,103 --> 00:29:34,315
- I wish I believed you.
- What's wrong, baby?

277
00:29:34,815 --> 00:29:35,900
Of course I am.

278
00:29:39,361 --> 00:29:41,030
<i>You're making me horny.</i>

279
00:29:41,197 --> 00:29:43,699
Go on, I have to keep working.
Listen.

280
00:29:44,283 --> 00:29:45,785
No matter what happens,

281
00:29:45,951 --> 00:29:48,537
don't come back here.
It was dangerous.

282
00:29:48,704 --> 00:29:50,080
Message, nothing else.

283
00:29:50,498 --> 00:29:52,374
I'm serious, baby.

284
00:29:58,672 --> 00:30:00,382
Can I come down?

285
00:30:02,092 --> 00:30:02,968
What?

286
00:30:03,219 --> 00:30:04,220
Can I come down?

287
00:30:07,431 --> 00:30:08,599
<i>I'll</i> be right up.

288
00:30:10,059 --> 00:30:11,560
You weren't going to show me
something?

289
00:30:18,692 --> 00:30:20,027
Is something wrong?

290
00:30:25,616 --> 00:30:27,827
Yeah, I wanted to show you...

291
00:30:27,993 --> 00:30:31,080
something on YouTube.
ls your daughter up there?

292
00:30:31,705 --> 00:30:33,541
- Yeah.
- Okay, I'll be right up.

293
00:30:37,878 --> 00:30:39,129
Okay.

294
00:32:26,487 --> 00:32:28,614
Sweetie, those felt pens
stain everything.

295
00:32:28,781 --> 00:32:31,492
Look at your hands.

296
00:32:34,203 --> 00:32:35,704
Okay, let's see.

297
00:32:36,163 --> 00:32:39,959
Cream cheese, sweet potato jelly,
toothpaste, wine, soap,

298
00:32:40,167 --> 00:32:42,461
rice, cookies, mayonnaise.
Anything else?

299
00:32:42,670 --> 00:32:43,879
Nothing else.

300
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:47,758
Don't worry, she won't go anywhere.
I think.

301
00:32:47,925 --> 00:32:49,885
Bye, sweetie!

302
00:32:56,141 --> 00:32:58,644
What you're drawing
is very pretty.

303
00:33:01,689 --> 00:33:03,732
It's beautiful, what is it?

304
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:08,320
Very pretty.

305
00:33:10,990 --> 00:33:12,533
That's a nice color.

306
00:33:13,617 --> 00:33:15,869
You don't want to tell me
what it is?

307
00:33:19,873 --> 00:33:21,750
Tell me when you finish it.

308
00:33:25,254 --> 00:33:27,047
Bye, Casimiro.

309
00:33:57,119 --> 00:34:00,748
<i>- These pipes move a lot.
- They need a brace.</i>

310
00:34:00,914 --> 00:34:03,500
<i>Maybe we should find something
bigger.</i>

311
00:34:03,667 --> 00:34:05,711
<i>Then we can get more
out of each trip.</i>

312
00:34:05,878 --> 00:34:07,546
<i>Yeah.</i>

313
00:34:08,464 --> 00:34:11,383
<i>Look what I found
in Puppet's things.</i>

314
00:34:12,509 --> 00:34:14,053
<i>Where was it?</i>

315
00:34:14,219 --> 00:34:16,305
<i>In the pocket of his backpack.</i>

316
00:34:16,638 --> 00:34:18,724
<i>He sent the last message</i>

317
00:34:18,891 --> 00:34:21,143
<i>at 11 P.M.
He's asleep now.</i>

318
00:34:22,352 --> 00:34:24,646
<i>Get Puppet over here.</i>

319
00:34:25,731 --> 00:34:28,192
<i>Lefty, where did you find
this guy?</i>

320
00:34:28,567 --> 00:34:30,527
<i>You know where. Why?</i>

321
00:34:30,694 --> 00:34:32,404
<i>He sent the address
of the bank.</i>

322
00:35:04,436 --> 00:35:05,771
Why?

323
00:35:06,438 --> 00:35:08,065
Why the fuck did you hit me?

324
00:35:10,567 --> 00:35:11,860
What is this?

325
00:35:16,031 --> 00:35:19,743
Tell me, I'm listening.
What is this doing here?

326
00:35:21,245 --> 00:35:22,162
I didn't realize.

327
00:35:22,329 --> 00:35:24,206
You didn't realize what?

328
00:35:25,457 --> 00:35:28,710
The cell phone.
I forgot that I had it.

329
00:35:34,550 --> 00:35:36,426
Lay on the table.

330
00:35:43,267 --> 00:35:44,977
No, why?

331
00:35:45,602 --> 00:35:46,979
Lefty, pal, explain it to him.

332
00:35:48,438 --> 00:35:50,691
Lower your voice
and lay on the table.

333
00:35:51,275 --> 00:35:54,194
I'm sorry, sir, I didn't mean to...

334
00:35:54,361 --> 00:35:56,405
You'd better do as I say.

335
00:35:59,074 --> 00:36:01,743
I put it in my bag before...

336
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:04,997
Stop talking. I'll listen to you
when you lay on the table.

337
00:36:25,392 --> 00:36:27,811
Don't tie me up, guys.
There's no need.

338
00:36:27,978 --> 00:36:30,189
I forgot I had it...

339
00:36:30,355 --> 00:36:32,691
It's okay, we'll let you talk.
It's okay.

340
00:36:33,734 --> 00:36:35,569
We're going to tie you up,
it's not up to you.

341
00:36:35,736 --> 00:36:38,655
I put it in my bag
and I forgot...

342
00:36:39,114 --> 00:36:41,783
I forgot, that's all...

343
00:36:42,201 --> 00:36:44,953
Don't tie me up, guys.
There's no need.

344
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,830
You know what?
Let me talk.

345
00:36:47,122 --> 00:36:48,665
You can talk after.

346
00:36:49,333 --> 00:36:51,877
I asked you, like the others,
if you could disappear.

347
00:36:52,711 --> 00:36:54,713
Yeah, I can, I can...

348
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:57,841
I also checked to make sure
it was true.

349
00:36:58,008 --> 00:36:59,635
And also we agreed

350
00:36:59,801 --> 00:37:01,595
that anyone who wanted to make

351
00:37:01,762 --> 00:37:05,515
a call or send a message
would do it in front of me, right?

352
00:37:05,724 --> 00:37:08,185
Yes, sir. You're right.

353
00:37:08,352 --> 00:37:10,479
I didn't mean to...

354
00:37:10,646 --> 00:37:12,773
Lower your voice
or I'll have to put a bullet

355
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:14,191
<i>in your head.</i>

356
00:37:14,358 --> 00:37:15,275
<i>I swear.</i>

357
00:37:15,442 --> 00:37:16,360
<i>I swear...</i>

358
00:37:16,526 --> 00:37:17,861
- I didn't know...
- Open your mouth.

359
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:20,197
No... No...

360
00:37:20,364 --> 00:37:22,616
I'm going to put this rag
in your mouth.

361
00:37:22,783 --> 00:37:24,785
- No...
- This is going to hurt.

362
00:37:24,952 --> 00:37:27,412
You'll scream. I'm going to stab you
in the leg with this screwdriver.

363
00:37:27,621 --> 00:37:29,581
I'll tell you anything.
Anything.

364
00:37:29,748 --> 00:37:33,043
Who did you send the message to
with the bank address?

365
00:37:33,210 --> 00:37:36,213
A girl named Jessica.
I like her.

366
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:38,006
I met her before we started.

367
00:37:38,173 --> 00:37:40,050
Why did you send her that?

368
00:37:40,384 --> 00:37:42,636
She was angry because
I hadn't written her.

369
00:37:42,803 --> 00:37:44,263
I thought I could see her

370
00:37:44,429 --> 00:37:45,973
when I went to do
the shopping.

371
00:37:46,139 --> 00:37:47,516
- That's the truth.
-ls it?

372
00:37:48,892 --> 00:37:50,560
That's what her messages said.

373
00:37:50,727 --> 00:37:52,980
It's true!
I'm telling the truth!

374
00:37:53,146 --> 00:37:54,731
What a fucking stupid reason
to die.

375
00:37:54,898 --> 00:37:57,317
Don't kill me.
I don't want to see her.

376
00:37:57,484 --> 00:37:59,403
Now you can't be here
anymore.

377
00:37:59,569 --> 00:38:01,446
Because now the girl knows
you didn't leave town.

378
00:38:01,613 --> 00:38:04,449
He told her he was working
near the bank.

379
00:38:04,616 --> 00:38:05,909
See what I mean?

380
00:38:06,076 --> 00:38:07,452
When she hears about
the robbery,

381
00:38:07,619 --> 00:38:11,206
she may be dumb,
but she'll connect you to this.

382
00:38:11,373 --> 00:38:14,251
What if she knows you've done

383
00:38:14,418 --> 00:38:16,003
other jobs before?

384
00:38:16,169 --> 00:38:17,629
She doesn't know, I swear.

385
00:38:17,796 --> 00:38:19,965
How do I know
if she knows or not?

386
00:38:20,132 --> 00:38:21,967
She must know someone
who knows you

387
00:38:22,134 --> 00:38:25,053
from the neighborhood
or strip club where you met her.

388
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:26,638
You know why this is happening?

389
00:38:26,805 --> 00:38:29,474
Because you didn't tell her
you were out of town.

390
00:38:30,017 --> 00:38:33,020
What's wrong, you idiot?
You think I'm sadistic?

391
00:38:40,193 --> 00:38:41,820
<i>Shut your mouth!</i>

392
00:38:41,987 --> 00:38:44,114
<i>Keep quiet or I'll really kill you.
You got that?</i>

393
00:38:48,869 --> 00:38:50,495
If you're a cop...

394
00:38:50,954 --> 00:38:55,208
and the messages were code,
tell me right now.

395
00:38:55,375 --> 00:38:59,755
Because Guttman is in on this.
You know who he is?

396
00:38:59,921 --> 00:39:00,839
No...

397
00:39:01,006 --> 00:39:02,549
I don't know who he is.

398
00:39:02,716 --> 00:39:05,135
If you're a cop, he's the only one
that can save you.

399
00:39:05,302 --> 00:39:07,137
I'm not a cop...

400
00:39:07,304 --> 00:39:11,933
I just want to keep working...

401
00:39:13,393 --> 00:39:15,103
I want to work!

402
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,190
Let me think it over.

403
00:39:18,357 --> 00:39:19,775
Just shut up and hold still.

404
00:39:19,941 --> 00:39:21,443
That's the best thing
you can do.

405
00:39:21,610 --> 00:39:22,986
Let me go...

406
00:39:24,529 --> 00:39:25,822
Let me go...

407
00:39:41,922 --> 00:39:43,006
Keep the cell phone.

408
00:39:43,173 --> 00:39:45,092
We have to keep texting the girl.

409
00:39:45,258 --> 00:39:47,135
What do we do with him?

410
00:39:47,302 --> 00:39:49,262
Guttman can help us out.

411
00:39:50,972 --> 00:39:53,225
<i>Get some plastic and tape.</i>

412
00:39:58,939 --> 00:40:00,273
Afraid?

413
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:05,654
I don't know, of normal things,
I guess.

414
00:40:07,864 --> 00:40:11,076
Taxi drivers, police,

415
00:40:11,451 --> 00:40:14,121
talk shows...

416
00:40:14,287 --> 00:40:16,623
Like anybody else.
My turn, right?

417
00:40:21,586 --> 00:40:22,629
Well...

418
00:40:29,594 --> 00:40:31,680
Will you ever walk again?

419
00:40:33,598 --> 00:40:34,641
I'd like to.

420
00:40:36,476 --> 00:40:38,186
Maybe with an operation.

421
00:40:38,353 --> 00:40:40,939
Really?
Why don't you do it?

422
00:40:41,523 --> 00:40:44,985
No, let's not talk about this.
Something else.

423
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:46,862
Okay, fine.

424
00:40:47,654 --> 00:40:48,572
Something else.

425
00:40:48,822 --> 00:40:51,199
- Yeah.
- Let's see.

426
00:40:58,415 --> 00:40:59,458
Ever been in love?

427
00:41:00,625 --> 00:41:01,751
Yeah.

428
00:41:02,085 --> 00:41:03,378
Once.

429
00:41:04,004 --> 00:41:05,797
My turn. You?

430
00:41:05,964 --> 00:41:08,133
Oh, many times.

431
00:41:09,468 --> 00:41:11,011
It's so easy

432
00:41:11,178 --> 00:41:14,055
to find someone
who doesn't just want to fuck you...

433
00:41:14,222 --> 00:41:16,141
Especially with a daughter...

434
00:41:18,602 --> 00:41:23,607
There are plenty of nice,
sweet guys out there...

435
00:41:24,024 --> 00:41:25,901
What does that mean?

436
00:41:26,985 --> 00:41:29,654
It means exactly what I said.

437
00:41:29,821 --> 00:41:32,657
I'll ask you another way.

438
00:41:36,495 --> 00:41:38,622
Are you seeing anyone?

439
00:41:40,832 --> 00:41:42,375
Why?

440
00:41:42,876 --> 00:41:44,878
Are you going to make
an indecent proposal?

441
00:41:45,045 --> 00:41:50,383
No, I just want to see
if you're telling me the truth.

442
00:41:58,308 --> 00:41:59,809
Tell me something.

443
00:42:02,270 --> 00:42:04,439
When was the last time
someone fell in love with you?

444
00:42:06,358 --> 00:42:09,778
I stopped thinking about that.

445
00:42:12,155 --> 00:42:14,658
Don't be ridiculous.

446
00:42:15,784 --> 00:42:18,954
Any girl could fall for you,
with or without

447
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:20,455
a wheelchair.

448
00:42:21,039 --> 00:42:22,123
Go ahead,

449
00:42:22,290 --> 00:42:26,836
laugh. You think women
are like men. That we only...

450
00:42:28,505 --> 00:42:29,839
What's wrong?

451
00:42:31,466 --> 00:42:33,176
What are you feeling?

452
00:42:34,094 --> 00:42:38,890
I don't know,
like I just smoked 8 joints.

453
00:42:39,516 --> 00:42:40,850
I don't know.

454
00:42:43,311 --> 00:42:45,438
I don't know what's wrong with me.

455
00:42:46,314 --> 00:42:48,567
Lie down in my bedroom.

456
00:42:50,527 --> 00:42:52,946
I think I can make it upstairs.

457
00:42:53,113 --> 00:42:55,991
No, you're not going to make it.

458
00:42:56,157 --> 00:42:58,159
Lie down here, it's okay.

459
00:43:00,495 --> 00:43:02,706
Oh, no...

460
00:43:06,209 --> 00:43:08,670
I don't know
what happened to me.

461
00:43:08,837 --> 00:43:11,339
I feel so out of it.

462
00:43:14,718 --> 00:43:16,970
What are you doing?
Stop!

463
00:43:17,137 --> 00:43:19,723
This is for the dizziness.

464
00:43:19,889 --> 00:43:22,475
- It will help you sleep.
- But...

465
00:43:23,268 --> 00:43:25,645
You can fuck me
without doing this.

466
00:43:25,812 --> 00:43:27,063
I'm not going to fuck you.

467
00:43:27,230 --> 00:43:30,609
I don't understand
why you're doing this.

468
00:43:31,526 --> 00:43:35,780
Because I know everything.
I know what you're doing.

469
00:43:35,947 --> 00:43:37,407
They'll kill you.

470
00:43:37,574 --> 00:43:39,242
They'll kill you.

471
00:43:39,868 --> 00:43:41,369
They'll kill you.

472
00:43:42,078 --> 00:43:44,080
You're going to sleep
for a while.

473
00:43:44,247 --> 00:43:46,082
What about Betty...?

474
00:43:46,625 --> 00:43:48,793
She has nothing to do with this.

475
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:50,211
Nothing...

476
00:43:50,378 --> 00:43:53,465
Betty will be fine.

477
00:43:57,427 --> 00:43:58,762
Careful.

478
00:43:59,137 --> 00:44:03,516
Are we ready? Just turn.
Try it.

479
00:44:03,683 --> 00:44:06,519
- Are we on schedule?
- I think so.

480
00:44:06,728 --> 00:44:08,438
Take note.

481
00:44:09,064 --> 00:44:12,567
Boxes 747 and 748 are
connected to the alarm,

482
00:44:12,734 --> 00:44:14,819
-but we can't touch them.
- Why?

483
00:44:14,986 --> 00:44:17,697
Guttman warned me.
They're full of cash

484
00:44:17,864 --> 00:44:21,034
but it's narco money.
If we touch it we're dead.

485
00:44:21,201 --> 00:44:25,205
Fuck, what if the narcos
have more money in there?

486
00:44:25,372 --> 00:44:29,334
Guttman is a schmuck
but he isn't fucking stupid.

487
00:44:29,501 --> 00:44:33,046
<i>Write it down:
do not touch 747 and 748.</i>

488
00:44:33,338 --> 00:44:35,757
<i>Look, Galereto.
This is what will explode.</i>

489
00:44:36,466 --> 00:44:37,717
Are you sure?

490
00:44:38,093 --> 00:44:40,011
I'll have to attach it
to the roof of the tunnel.

491
00:44:40,178 --> 00:44:43,014
It should stay there
a few hours before detonating.

492
00:44:46,393 --> 00:44:50,563
Okay, we'll prepare it
the night before we go in.

493
00:44:50,772 --> 00:44:52,816
Listen, we detonate it

494
00:44:53,024 --> 00:44:55,151
and a chunk of the vault
will collapse.

495
00:44:55,318 --> 00:44:58,613
- We can climb up.
- Excuse me, Princess.

496
00:44:58,863 --> 00:45:01,074
The schmuck calls me Princess.

497
00:45:01,241 --> 00:45:03,993
- You'll have to go in.
- Me?

498
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:06,204
- What?
- You have to replace Puppet.

499
00:45:06,371 --> 00:45:09,457
Damn it!
Can't somebody else go?

500
00:45:09,624 --> 00:45:12,585
<i>- Listen.
- Spare me your astrology bullshit.</i>

501
00:45:16,214 --> 00:45:18,717
I don't know what you're trying to do,

502
00:45:19,008 --> 00:45:20,885
but it won't work.

503
00:45:25,390 --> 00:45:27,016
What do you see in him?

504
00:45:30,103 --> 00:45:34,232
He would never hurt anyone.
He's not a bad person.

505
00:45:34,441 --> 00:45:36,818
He's been good to me
and Betty.

506
00:45:36,985 --> 00:45:41,531
He's a good father for Betty?
That's what you want?

507
00:45:51,875 --> 00:45:54,043
<i>Or in Corrientes, where you were born.</i>

508
00:45:54,210 --> 00:45:55,336
<i>She doesn't know anything, I swear.</i>

509
00:45:55,503 --> 00:45:58,256
<i>She must know someone
who knows you</i>

510
00:45:58,423 --> 00:46:02,385
<i>from the neighborhood
or strip club where you met her.</i>

511
00:46:02,552 --> 00:46:04,471
<i>You know why this is happening?</i>

512
00:46:04,637 --> 00:46:07,265
<i>Because you didn't tell her
you were out of town.</i>

513
00:46:08,141 --> 00:46:10,602
<i>What's wrong, you idiot?
You think I'm sadistic?</i>

514
00:46:16,816 --> 00:46:18,234
ls it good?

515
00:46:18,777 --> 00:46:20,570
Your mom isn't feeling well.

516
00:46:20,904 --> 00:46:23,323
You can see her
when she wakes up.

517
00:46:25,033 --> 00:46:27,285
Know what I was thinking,
Betty?

518
00:46:27,744 --> 00:46:31,748
I'd like you to bring down
your things from upstairs

519
00:46:32,290 --> 00:46:33,291
and you can sleep

520
00:46:33,458 --> 00:46:35,919
in a room down here,
that one over there.

521
00:46:36,085 --> 00:46:39,422
The one that's locked.
It's a beautiful room.

522
00:46:39,798 --> 00:46:42,217
<i>I didn't do anything.</i>

523
00:46:43,259 --> 00:46:45,094
<i>I didn't do anything...</i>

524
00:46:55,271 --> 00:46:57,482
So bring your clothes down,
okay?

525
00:46:58,107 --> 00:47:00,485
You can take Casimiro with you.

526
00:47:01,110 --> 00:47:02,695
Is that okay?

527
00:47:14,123 --> 00:47:16,668
Don't be afraid, Betty.

528
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:20,338
Don't be afraid of me.

529
00:47:21,130 --> 00:47:23,550
I promise I'll never hurt you.

530
00:47:24,425 --> 00:47:25,718
Ever.

531
00:47:27,262 --> 00:47:30,849
I'll never do anything bad to you.

532
00:47:32,141 --> 00:47:34,394
We need to find Casimiro a...

533
00:47:35,061 --> 00:47:37,105
a blanket or something.

534
00:47:41,818 --> 00:47:43,111
Come on.

535
00:48:09,554 --> 00:48:12,599
You can play with anything
in here.

536
00:48:13,766 --> 00:48:15,560
Anything you want.

537
00:49:07,070 --> 00:49:09,989
How long has it been
since Betty last spoke?

538
00:49:10,782 --> 00:49:13,117
When she was 4 years old.

539
00:49:13,326 --> 00:49:15,495
And one day she just stopped talking.

540
00:49:22,293 --> 00:49:24,504
Nothing I told you was a lie.

541
00:49:24,671 --> 00:49:25,546
Nothing.

542
00:49:25,713 --> 00:49:28,508
I believed everything you told me.

543
00:49:33,012 --> 00:49:34,681
What are you going to do?

544
00:49:35,014 --> 00:49:37,767
Maybe I can help you avoid
them killing you.

545
00:49:38,518 --> 00:49:39,477
They won't kill me.

546
00:49:40,561 --> 00:49:44,565
Be careful when you send
text messages from my phone.

547
00:49:44,732 --> 00:49:45,775
You have to put

548
00:49:45,942 --> 00:49:47,485
a space before the first word.

549
00:49:47,652 --> 00:49:49,153
Repeat some letters

550
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:51,739
-and always end with a period.
- You think

551
00:49:51,906 --> 00:49:54,617
I can't beat him?
I already noticed.

552
00:49:55,952 --> 00:49:57,578
He's going to realize.

553
00:50:00,206 --> 00:50:02,041
I'm going to steal
part of what they take.

554
00:50:02,583 --> 00:50:04,544
Are you crazy?

555
00:50:04,711 --> 00:50:06,713
Three will be in the bank,
three waiting for the money.

556
00:50:06,879 --> 00:50:08,965
Joaquin, you can't do that.

557
00:50:09,132 --> 00:50:12,552
You haven't seen what
they're capable of.

558
00:50:13,302 --> 00:50:15,096
There's no way they'll notice.

559
00:50:15,596 --> 00:50:18,474
Sell this house if you need money.
Why do that?

560
00:50:33,990 --> 00:50:35,700
<i>Son of a bitch!</i>

561
00:50:37,744 --> 00:50:38,536
<i>What's wrong?</i>

562
00:50:38,911 --> 00:50:41,122
There's a pipe
that shouldn't be there.

563
00:50:41,289 --> 00:50:43,708
- A pipe?
- Yeah, a large water pipe.

564
00:50:44,083 --> 00:50:45,793
There can't be a pipe there.

565
00:50:46,044 --> 00:50:48,629
The pipe is right in the middle.
Right in the middle.

566
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:50,757
Did we turn too soon?

567
00:50:51,674 --> 00:50:55,303
This has to be the pipe,
it's the only one.

568
00:50:55,470 --> 00:50:58,139
Then we must have done this.

569
00:50:58,306 --> 00:51:01,225
They turned 2 meters too soon.
How did you fuck this up?

570
00:51:01,392 --> 00:51:04,062
- Spaniards don't know the metric system?
- Shut up!

571
00:51:04,437 --> 00:51:07,190
We barely touched it.

572
00:51:07,482 --> 00:51:09,150
<i>How much time have we lost?</i>

573
00:51:09,317 --> 00:51:12,653
BUENOS AIRES WATER PIPES

574
00:51:12,862 --> 00:51:14,655
<i>We won't make it
to the day after tomorrow?</i>

575
00:51:17,241 --> 00:51:21,746
We have to correct several meters
and prepare the roof for the charge.

576
00:51:21,913 --> 00:51:23,289
Forget about Saturday.

577
00:51:24,123 --> 00:51:26,167
We wait until Sunday
and go in earlier.

578
00:51:28,461 --> 00:51:32,590
- What's wrong?
- This is much better.

579
00:51:32,757 --> 00:51:36,636
Yeah, Mars and Saturn were out of line.
Working 4 more hours a day we can make it up.

580
00:51:36,803 --> 00:51:38,721
- Seriously?
- We have no choice.

581
00:51:38,888 --> 00:51:40,723
Start correcting.

582
00:51:42,767 --> 00:51:44,852
Look at this.
Am I a genius or what?

583
00:51:45,436 --> 00:51:47,480
What the fuck are you talking about?

584
00:51:47,647 --> 00:51:51,025
Instead of the shitty carts,
we'll use this.

585
00:51:51,192 --> 00:51:53,694
We can fit more.
Less trips, less time.

586
00:51:53,861 --> 00:51:56,239
If it tips over, nothing falls out.

587
00:51:57,406 --> 00:51:59,408
Put wheels on it
and we'll try it out.

588
00:55:22,903 --> 00:55:25,865
That's why I'm saying
we need to be careful.

589
00:55:26,615 --> 00:55:30,036
I know that. You think I'm not
careful enough?

590
00:55:33,873 --> 00:55:35,082
Pass me the tape measure.

591
00:55:36,542 --> 00:55:38,169
We need light.

592
00:55:46,594 --> 00:55:48,220
Come on, bonehead.

593
00:55:49,305 --> 00:55:50,806
You'll get covered in dirt.

594
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:56,062
Here, put it on the table.
I don't want it to get dirty.

595
00:56:12,953 --> 00:56:14,538
The lights are on.

596
00:56:14,705 --> 00:56:16,999
What dumbshits.

597
00:56:20,503 --> 00:56:22,296
Look, these are burned out.

598
00:56:22,463 --> 00:56:25,966
Leaving them on all day
with the heat down here.

599
00:56:35,810 --> 00:56:37,645
- Come on, go faster.
- Wait, wait...

600
00:56:44,527 --> 00:56:45,277
It looks okay.

601
00:56:45,444 --> 00:56:47,321
It's what they said.

602
00:56:52,743 --> 00:56:55,246
- Did you measure right?
- Yeah.

603
00:56:56,664 --> 00:56:59,583
Lefty's taking everything
to the house in Lomas.

604
00:56:59,750 --> 00:57:00,876
That place is perfect.

605
00:57:02,294 --> 00:57:05,548
You mean he knows about
the house in Lomas?

606
00:57:06,549 --> 00:57:08,676
Him, you and me.
Nobody else.

607
00:57:11,554 --> 00:57:14,765
You might as well put our hideout
in the newspaper.

608
00:57:15,433 --> 00:57:18,602
Did something happen between
you and Lefty?

609
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:21,689
No, nothing.
You're the boss here.

610
00:57:21,856 --> 00:57:23,357
But did something happen?

611
00:57:23,732 --> 00:57:29,363
I just think you're trusting people
too much who you hardly know.

612
00:57:30,239 --> 00:57:32,032
Don't bust my balls, Pedro.

613
00:57:32,199 --> 00:57:33,993
Lefty's a good guy.

614
00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:36,912
If you know something I don't,
tell me.

615
00:57:37,705 --> 00:57:39,999
Lefty's a good guy.

616
00:57:40,166 --> 00:57:44,628
He won't give us any trouble.
He's great at what he does.

617
00:57:46,797 --> 00:57:49,425
Yeah, he's the one
who brought Puppet.

618
00:57:49,884 --> 00:57:51,886
Stop busting my balls.

619
00:57:52,052 --> 00:57:54,430
You always get like this
with somebody new.

620
00:57:54,597 --> 00:57:56,098
You're my brother, I trust you.

621
00:57:56,682 --> 00:58:00,352
What do you mean, you jerk?
That I'm jealous? Why ask me

622
00:58:00,519 --> 00:58:02,730
if you know him better than me.

623
00:58:02,897 --> 00:58:04,440
Why the hell are you asking me?

624
00:58:05,649 --> 00:58:07,485
This is great, a fucking Spaniard,

625
00:58:07,651 --> 00:58:10,196
a stutterer, a lesbian

626
00:58:10,362 --> 00:58:14,408
and a puppet.
What a melting pot.

627
00:58:35,429 --> 00:58:36,514
Betty.

628
00:58:39,141 --> 00:58:40,476
Betty...

629
00:58:48,692 --> 00:58:50,069
Betty.

630
00:58:51,946 --> 00:58:53,155
Betty!

631
00:59:29,608 --> 00:59:30,985
Betty...

632
00:59:33,279 --> 00:59:34,863
Betty... Betty!

633
00:59:49,295 --> 00:59:51,130
It's an illusion they created

634
00:59:51,297 --> 00:59:53,132
to dominate, so people
won't bother them.

635
00:59:53,299 --> 00:59:54,967
I know, I know.

636
00:59:55,134 --> 00:59:56,468
It's true, you're right.

637
00:59:56,635 --> 00:59:59,805
And they call it "ethics."
Like I read once:

638
00:59:59,972 --> 01:00:02,224
"What's robbing a bank
compared to founding one?"

639
01:00:02,641 --> 01:00:03,892
Where is Guttman?

640
01:00:17,781 --> 01:00:20,159
Falling a day behind
is not good.

641
01:00:21,702 --> 01:00:23,370
It's not good.

642
01:00:23,871 --> 01:00:25,289
Of course it's not good, Guttman.

643
01:00:26,290 --> 01:00:28,334
But sometimes unexpected things
happen.

644
01:00:31,086 --> 01:00:32,963
We're done with the curve.

645
01:00:33,339 --> 01:00:36,592
Tonight we'll be under
the safety deposit boxes.

646
01:00:38,302 --> 01:00:40,471
Then we go in the day
after tomorrow?

647
01:00:42,973 --> 01:00:46,226
The tunnel will end
10 centimeters under the vault

648
01:00:46,393 --> 01:00:49,229
for a small explosive.
We detonate and go in.

649
01:00:49,396 --> 01:00:52,066
It's faster and we won't need
so many tools.

650
01:00:52,399 --> 01:00:53,609
We'll go in at 8.

651
01:00:53,776 --> 01:00:56,236
But then the partying won't cover
the noise?

652
01:00:56,403 --> 01:01:00,240
On the 25th people light
firecrackers all day too.

653
01:01:02,284 --> 01:01:03,327
- Lefty, what's wrong?
- What?

654
01:01:03,494 --> 01:01:05,621
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

655
01:01:06,705 --> 01:01:10,626
I can't find my watch.
I left it here and it's gone.

656
01:01:10,793 --> 01:01:12,711
If you need to interrupt
for any other

657
01:01:12,878 --> 01:01:14,588
important reason,
go ahead.

658
01:01:15,381 --> 01:01:17,591
The explosion
won't be too big, right?

659
01:01:17,758 --> 01:01:20,594
We used it on another job.
Nobody will hear it.

660
01:01:20,761 --> 01:01:21,887
Let's go.

661
01:01:22,429 --> 01:01:23,722
It's going to rain on Sunday.

662
01:01:24,890 --> 01:01:26,475
That's good for us.

663
01:01:26,642 --> 01:01:30,062
Monday is when they'll realize.
After that,

664
01:01:30,229 --> 01:01:31,939
it's your problem, Guttman.

665
01:01:33,524 --> 01:01:37,403
Yeah, and you guys
will be far away by then.

666
01:01:37,569 --> 01:01:38,946
What's wrong, Canario?

667
01:01:39,196 --> 01:01:41,740
The tarp looked funny to me.

668
01:01:46,078 --> 01:01:48,122
I need to talk to you.

669
01:01:56,171 --> 01:01:57,339
<i>Look.</i>

670
01:01:57,881 --> 01:02:01,719
These are the safety deposit boxes
you can't touch

671
01:02:01,885 --> 01:02:03,637
because they're connected
to the alarm.

672
01:02:03,804 --> 01:02:05,639
- Got it?
- Got it.

673
01:02:12,771 --> 01:02:15,107
Is it true you're retiring
after this job?

674
01:02:16,483 --> 01:02:17,776
That's right.

675
01:02:18,193 --> 01:02:19,528
That's what they all say.

676
01:02:20,237 --> 01:02:22,489
There's a girl.
I'm leaving with her.

677
01:02:23,073 --> 01:02:26,577
Money and the girl I love,
all at once.

678
01:02:29,329 --> 01:02:32,374
Write down this number:
155.

679
01:02:34,710 --> 01:02:36,503
155? ls that the one?

680
01:02:36,754 --> 01:02:38,213
<i>Yeah.</i>

681
01:02:39,047 --> 01:02:41,425
You'll find an envelope,

682
01:02:41,592 --> 01:02:44,136
loose papers,
it doesn't matter.

683
01:02:44,595 --> 01:02:47,806
Anything in there
is what I'm after.

684
01:02:48,557 --> 01:02:50,559
You're not going to tell me
what it is?

685
01:02:50,726 --> 01:02:52,686
Trust me, you don't want to know.

686
01:02:52,853 --> 01:02:54,980
If you're smart,
you won't look either.

687
01:02:56,315 --> 01:03:00,944
Guttman, I don't give a shit
what they're extorting you with.

688
01:03:01,111 --> 01:03:04,948
Photos banging your mother
or a 3-month-old baby

689
01:03:05,115 --> 01:03:08,786
or a government minister,
I don't care.

690
01:03:10,454 --> 01:03:12,915
Everything will be down
on Sunday.

691
01:03:13,707 --> 01:03:15,959
I can send the patrols
somewhere else.

692
01:03:16,794 --> 01:03:19,546
But only until 11,
after that I can't.

693
01:03:19,880 --> 01:03:22,424
Stay calm and don't make
a mess.

694
01:03:39,316 --> 01:03:41,819
Here, give me your hand.

695
01:03:42,361 --> 01:03:43,529
Come on.

696
01:03:48,075 --> 01:03:50,077
It's over, it's over.

697
01:03:51,620 --> 01:03:53,747
It's over, it's over.

698
01:03:57,793 --> 01:03:59,086
Are you okay?

699
01:03:59,336 --> 01:04:01,922
It's over. It's over.

700
01:04:09,012 --> 01:04:10,222
What's this?

701
01:04:10,764 --> 01:04:11,807
What's this?

702
01:04:11,974 --> 01:04:12,891
What did you do?

703
01:04:23,318 --> 01:04:25,404
Stop, stop, stop.
Please.

704
01:04:25,612 --> 01:04:26,780
Stop.

705
01:04:28,240 --> 01:04:30,450
Let me go, please...

706
01:04:31,493 --> 01:04:34,329
He's calling you.
I need you to answer it.

707
01:04:34,496 --> 01:04:36,290
Please, I'm asking you.

708
01:04:36,456 --> 01:04:38,792
- Help me.
- Why should I help you?

709
01:04:40,043 --> 01:04:42,629
Because I'm asking you to,
damn it!

710
01:04:45,048 --> 01:04:46,258
Let me go.

711
01:04:46,425 --> 01:04:47,593
You know Betty talks?

712
01:04:47,926 --> 01:04:49,887
She talks to Casimiro.

713
01:04:54,516 --> 01:04:57,936
I put a microphone
on his collar. Listen.

714
01:05:01,940 --> 01:05:05,485
<i>Come on, Casimiro.
Pm not going to hurt you.</i>

715
01:05:06,194 --> 01:05:08,113
<i>Are you hungry?</i>

716
01:05:09,364 --> 01:05:11,116
<i>Come here, I'll give you a kiss.</i>

717
01:05:13,911 --> 01:05:15,913
No, please.

718
01:05:16,079 --> 01:05:18,415
Let me keep listening.
Please.

719
01:05:18,582 --> 01:05:19,917
Please.

720
01:05:20,584 --> 01:05:23,754
You said she was 4
when she stopped talking.

721
01:05:23,921 --> 01:05:24,755
Yes.

722
01:05:24,922 --> 01:05:27,007
How old is she now, 6?

723
01:05:27,674 --> 01:05:28,842
Two years?

724
01:05:29,009 --> 01:05:31,219
When did this guy
come into your life?

725
01:05:31,386 --> 01:05:32,512
When did you meet Galereto?

726
01:05:35,891 --> 01:05:38,560
More or less the same.
A little over two years.

727
01:05:38,727 --> 01:05:40,854
A little over two years?

728
01:05:43,231 --> 01:05:46,234
<i>Mommy's boyfriend
wants you to do these things.</i>

729
01:05:47,235 --> 01:05:49,655
<i>We're going to play a game.</i>

730
01:05:50,906 --> 01:05:53,533
<i>But we can't tell Mommy.</i>

731
01:05:54,493 --> 01:05:57,245
<i>Mommy will be jealous
if we tell her.</i>

732
01:05:58,664 --> 01:06:02,000
<i>Boys and girls always play
like this.</i>

733
01:06:02,960 --> 01:06:05,087
<i>Come here, little one.</i>

734
01:06:06,505 --> 01:06:08,423
<i>Don't be afraid, Casimiro.</i>

735
01:06:08,590 --> 01:06:09,216
No, no!

736
01:06:09,383 --> 01:06:10,759
<i>It's okay.</i>

737
01:06:10,968 --> 01:06:13,845
No,no,no!

738
01:06:20,185 --> 01:06:22,354
No, please!

739
01:06:22,688 --> 01:06:24,564
She's okay now, she's okay.

740
01:06:24,731 --> 01:06:26,942
She's playing with some toys
I gave her.

741
01:06:27,150 --> 01:06:30,570
That son of a bitch!
That son of a bitch!

742
01:06:31,196 --> 01:06:34,616
Now that we know,
we can help her.

743
01:06:37,327 --> 01:06:39,788
I'll ruin his life, I swear.

744
01:06:39,955 --> 01:06:43,000
I don't care about that.

745
01:06:43,166 --> 01:06:44,918
I can screw him over.

746
01:06:45,085 --> 01:06:48,588
I'm going to flood the tunnel.
I'll ruin his whole plan.

747
01:06:48,755 --> 01:06:51,550
I can ruin his life.

748
01:06:51,717 --> 01:06:54,553
I'm going to kill him!
I'm going to kill him!

749
01:06:54,720 --> 01:06:58,515
Calm down.
I need you to calm down.

750
01:07:00,726 --> 01:07:03,979
Think about what's happening.

751
01:07:05,480 --> 01:07:06,565
And help me.

752
01:07:06,732 --> 01:07:08,483
What do you want me to do?

753
01:07:09,109 --> 01:07:11,069
Call him, talk to him.

754
01:07:11,236 --> 01:07:13,030
Tell him everything is fine.

755
01:07:13,196 --> 01:07:16,033
That everything is fine.
Not to worry.

756
01:07:16,616 --> 01:07:18,869
Tell him everything's fine.

757
01:07:19,828 --> 01:07:22,414
He's calling you.
Talk to him.

758
01:07:25,083 --> 01:07:26,501
Hi.

759
01:07:27,627 --> 01:07:30,380
<i>- How are</i> you?
<i>- Fine. What's happend?</i>

760
01:07:31,173 --> 01:07:34,384
Yeah, I'm whispering
because he's nearby.

761
01:07:34,551 --> 01:07:37,596
- Everything <i>is okay?</i>
- I can't talk long.

762
01:07:38,138 --> 01:07:41,558
Don't worry, he hasn't gone
to the basement.

763
01:07:43,351 --> 01:07:45,604
Yeah, I miss you too.

764
01:07:50,567 --> 01:07:52,444
Not my baby...

765
01:07:52,611 --> 01:07:55,197
Son of a bitch!

766
01:07:55,864 --> 01:07:57,574
Son of a bitch...

767
01:07:57,908 --> 01:08:01,036
No, no!
Don't shoot me up anymore!

768
01:08:01,203 --> 01:08:04,623
Please! Let me see her!
I need to see her!

769
01:08:05,123 --> 01:08:07,375
Please, trust me.

770
01:08:07,542 --> 01:08:09,795
- Please.
- Trust me.

771
01:08:11,338 --> 01:08:13,256
Everything will be okay.

772
01:10:14,669 --> 01:10:17,672
What, you still think your watch
is going to show up?

773
01:10:17,839 --> 01:10:19,299
I left it here.

774
01:10:19,591 --> 01:10:22,093
We're all decent people here.

775
01:10:25,972 --> 01:10:28,391
It could be in the bags of dirt.

776
01:10:28,558 --> 01:10:34,606
Finally after 500 years a Spaniard
finally brings something to this land.

777
01:10:35,440 --> 01:10:37,400
What's your fucking problem,
Canario?

778
01:10:37,567 --> 01:10:40,237
Everything I do bothers you.

779
01:10:40,570 --> 01:10:43,531
Everything okay?
ls it still intact?

780
01:10:43,698 --> 01:10:45,075
Yeah. It hasn't moved.

781
01:10:45,242 --> 01:10:47,535
- Did you check the charge?
- Yeah.

782
01:10:48,745 --> 01:10:52,999
Don't worry. A piece of the floor
will fall, not the whole bank.

783
01:10:53,500 --> 01:10:54,542
Okay...

784
01:10:54,918 --> 01:10:57,212
We did a good job.

785
01:10:57,879 --> 01:11:00,674
Clear your minds,
don't say anything.

786
01:11:02,008 --> 01:11:04,844
- Can we get some rest?
- Yeah.

787
01:11:05,512 --> 01:11:07,264
We go in at 8.

788
01:11:25,782 --> 01:11:27,534
I'm going to lock the door, okay?

789
01:11:27,701 --> 01:11:29,286
I'll be right back.

790
01:16:19,242 --> 01:16:20,368
Do you need to check it?

791
01:16:21,869 --> 01:16:22,912
No.

792
01:16:50,189 --> 01:16:51,816
And René?

793
01:16:57,697 --> 01:16:58,656
What do we do?

794
01:16:58,823 --> 01:17:01,367
- Everything's ready.
- Then let's do it.

795
01:17:01,534 --> 01:17:03,202
- It's stupid to wait.
- Let's go.

796
01:17:03,369 --> 01:17:04,912
We should wait until the right time.

797
01:17:05,079 --> 01:17:08,541
No, no, no.
We blow it and go in now.

798
01:17:08,750 --> 01:17:09,542
Okay.

799
01:17:10,084 --> 01:17:12,378
Pass me the detonator.

800
01:17:15,256 --> 01:17:17,133
Turn on the ventilator.

801
01:17:18,760 --> 01:17:20,845
- Where's the wire?
- Come on.

802
01:17:21,012 --> 01:17:23,973
- Get out of there.
- Let's go.

803
01:17:24,140 --> 01:17:25,850
Watch your head.

804
01:17:26,017 --> 01:17:28,061
- Get out of there.
- Come on, you idiot.

805
01:17:28,227 --> 01:17:29,771
Come on, here we go!
Let's go.

806
01:17:29,937 --> 01:17:30,897
Here we go!

807
01:18:10,061 --> 01:18:11,896
- Go on.
- Wait.

808
01:18:12,313 --> 01:18:13,815
Careful, you'll hit your head.

809
01:18:13,981 --> 01:18:15,566
Tell me if everything's okay.

810
01:18:16,359 --> 01:18:18,319
Go ahead.

811
01:18:20,530 --> 01:18:22,532
Pass me that rope.

812
01:18:22,699 --> 01:18:24,033
Here.

813
01:18:40,925 --> 01:18:42,051
Come on.

814
01:21:07,864 --> 01:21:09,407
Come here.

815
01:21:10,992 --> 01:21:13,452
Listen.
It sounds like water.

816
01:21:33,264 --> 01:21:35,433
There's water down there?

817
01:21:36,309 --> 01:21:39,145
René, can you hear me?
ls there water down there?

818
01:21:50,573 --> 01:21:51,782
We need to get out!

819
01:21:52,074 --> 01:21:53,784
Bring everything!
We have to get out!

820
01:22:22,396 --> 01:22:23,898
What are you doing?

821
01:22:24,065 --> 01:22:25,274
We're not going to make it.

822
01:22:25,858 --> 01:22:27,360
We're not going to make it.

823
01:22:29,236 --> 01:22:32,281
Canario!
I can't make it, Canario!

824
01:22:32,740 --> 01:22:34,158
I can't see her!

825
01:22:34,325 --> 01:22:36,285
Don't go down there,
it could collapse.

826
01:22:36,452 --> 01:22:38,663
We need to get out of here!
Come on!

827
01:22:48,089 --> 01:22:49,632
Canario!

828
01:22:50,132 --> 01:22:52,134
Canario, you bastard!

829
01:23:07,316 --> 01:23:09,318
Help me! Help me!

830
01:23:10,987 --> 01:23:12,154
Help me, you bastard!

831
01:23:15,741 --> 01:23:18,536
There's a guy down here!
Son of a bitch!

832
01:23:19,203 --> 01:23:20,788
I've got him!

833
01:23:21,288 --> 01:23:24,291
Help me, you bastard!
There's a guy down here!

834
01:23:24,458 --> 01:23:26,002
He's down here!

835
01:23:40,850 --> 01:23:42,893
Open up! Open UP!

836
01:23:43,060 --> 01:23:46,313
Open up, you son of a bitch!

837
01:23:46,480 --> 01:23:49,108
Open Up, Open up!

838
01:23:50,234 --> 01:23:51,777
Help me!

839
01:23:52,611 --> 01:23:54,030
Open up!

840
01:25:49,728 --> 01:25:51,564
We have to sound the alarm.

841
01:26:10,958 --> 01:26:12,459
Berta.

842
01:26:13,002 --> 01:26:14,295
Berta.

843
01:26:16,380 --> 01:26:17,965
Berta.

844
01:26:23,804 --> 01:26:26,849
Berta.
Berta, can you hear me?

845
01:26:27,600 --> 01:26:29,351
It didn't go right.

846
01:26:30,644 --> 01:26:32,479
I killed someone, Berta.

847
01:26:41,614 --> 01:26:42,781
Where's my daughter?

848
01:26:44,033 --> 01:26:45,784
I just saw her, she's fine.

849
01:26:46,202 --> 01:26:48,120
The money's there.

850
01:26:48,370 --> 01:26:50,748
In the closet, in the backpack.

851
01:26:50,915 --> 01:26:52,750
I don't give a shit about the money.

852
01:26:53,167 --> 01:26:54,460
Tell me what happened.

853
01:26:54,627 --> 01:26:55,961
They left.

854
01:26:56,962 --> 01:26:58,797
You idiot!

855
01:27:00,132 --> 01:27:02,718
They'll come back! And what do you
think will happen to me?

856
01:27:03,844 --> 01:27:05,095
I couldn't trust you.

857
01:27:05,262 --> 01:27:06,555
Yes, you could.

858
01:27:07,056 --> 01:27:08,432
You know you could.

859
01:27:09,099 --> 01:27:11,352
Now you're on your own.

860
01:27:12,728 --> 01:27:14,647
I didn't risk you two.

861
01:27:17,191 --> 01:27:18,776
I didn't...

862
01:27:23,447 --> 01:27:26,659
You don't know what it means.
I have to take care of her, Joaquin.

863
01:27:28,160 --> 01:27:29,495
I have to go.

864
01:27:29,954 --> 01:27:31,580
Let me go.

865
01:27:31,830 --> 01:27:33,832
I have to take care of my daughter.

866
01:27:36,126 --> 01:27:37,878
I can take care of you both.

867
01:27:39,797 --> 01:27:41,423
We can leave, the three of us.

868
01:27:42,675 --> 01:27:44,385
Together.

869
01:27:50,599 --> 01:27:52,142
I'm sorry.

870
01:27:54,603 --> 01:27:56,605
I really like you.

871
01:27:57,940 --> 01:27:58,941
But I can't.

872
01:28:25,342 --> 01:28:27,678
Here!

873
01:28:29,013 --> 01:28:31,598
We're trapped in the vault!

874
01:28:56,832 --> 01:28:59,126
Excuse me. Excuse me!

875
01:29:09,136 --> 01:29:10,179
Over here, over here.

876
01:29:18,312 --> 01:29:19,813
Over here, over here.

877
01:29:21,148 --> 01:29:23,984
Excuse me, sir.
You can't be here.

878
01:29:24,151 --> 01:29:27,654
I live over there.
My basement is flooded.

879
01:29:27,821 --> 01:29:29,656
They cut the water and they're
going to pump it out.

880
01:29:29,823 --> 01:29:33,452
Go back to your home.
You can't be here.

881
01:29:34,536 --> 01:29:36,288
Okay, thanks.

882
01:29:41,877 --> 01:29:43,545
- Hello.
- What happened?

883
01:29:43,712 --> 01:29:45,964
I have no fucking idea
what happened.

884
01:29:46,131 --> 01:29:48,258
Water started coming
from everywhere.

885
01:29:49,760 --> 01:29:51,136
<i>Calm down.</i>

886
01:29:51,303 --> 01:29:54,681
Calm down? I have three people
in the vault!

887
01:29:54,848 --> 01:29:56,016
Where are you?

888
01:29:56,266 --> 01:29:58,018
<i>Did you get my things?</i>

889
01:29:58,185 --> 01:29:59,645
There wasn't time.

890
01:29:59,812 --> 01:30:02,022
<i>Everything flooded...</i>

891
01:30:02,564 --> 01:30:04,900
Hello? Hello?

892
01:30:11,740 --> 01:30:13,158
Who is it?

893
01:30:13,325 --> 01:30:14,451
Police!

894
01:30:19,957 --> 01:30:22,918
Good evening, sir.
Officer Cristiani.

895
01:30:23,085 --> 01:30:24,253
- Are you alone at home?
- No.

896
01:30:24,420 --> 01:30:25,879
My wife and daughter
are here.

897
01:30:26,296 --> 01:30:28,757
Would you mind if we came inside?

898
01:30:28,924 --> 01:30:32,177
Please, I was waiting
for someone to come.

899
01:30:32,344 --> 01:30:34,471
My whole basement is flooded.
All my work stuff.

900
01:30:34,638 --> 01:30:38,475
I went outside and they said
to wait here.

901
01:30:38,642 --> 01:30:41,812
Apparently a pipe burst
under the bank.

902
01:30:43,147 --> 01:30:47,693
And who's going to pay for
my stuff down there? The bank?

903
01:30:47,860 --> 01:30:49,736
Where are your wife
and daughter?

904
01:30:49,903 --> 01:30:52,823
They're asleep. With this mess,
I didn't want to wake them up.

905
01:30:52,990 --> 01:30:54,575
Please tell them not to worry.

906
01:30:54,741 --> 01:30:57,202
We have to search the house.

907
01:30:57,369 --> 01:31:00,581
You have to search my house
because of a broken pipe?

908
01:31:01,915 --> 01:31:04,251
It looks like someone
tried to rob the bank.

909
01:31:05,127 --> 01:31:07,463
Please, let's not waste
any more time.

910
01:31:07,880 --> 01:31:10,132
- Okay.
- Go with him.

911
01:31:19,600 --> 01:31:23,353
They're here to see why
it's flooded. It's okay.

912
01:31:35,532 --> 01:31:37,868
I'll leave the flashlight there.

913
01:32:53,944 --> 01:32:58,365
If it was a robbery,
will the bank pay for the damage?

914
01:32:58,657 --> 01:33:02,828
This is only the beginning.
You'll have to be patient.

915
01:33:06,873 --> 01:33:07,958
No.

916
01:33:08,125 --> 01:33:09,668
No, no, thanks.

917
01:33:09,835 --> 01:33:11,837
No, no, really.

918
01:33:15,632 --> 01:33:17,175
I have to go.

919
01:33:18,302 --> 01:33:20,887
Come and shut the door.

920
01:33:30,147 --> 01:33:32,107
Give me your cell phone.

921
01:33:35,193 --> 01:33:36,945
That one right there.

922
01:33:53,754 --> 01:33:54,546
Here.

923
01:33:54,713 --> 01:33:56,923
Now you have my number.

924
01:33:57,215 --> 01:33:59,134
If you find anything strange

925
01:33:59,301 --> 01:34:01,261
or you remember anything,

926
01:34:01,470 --> 01:34:03,096
call me.

927
01:34:05,557 --> 01:34:06,767
Okay.

928
01:34:09,394 --> 01:34:12,981
Another team will come tomorrow
to take a closer look.

929
01:34:13,148 --> 01:34:16,026
Leave everything where it is,
don't touch anything.

930
01:34:16,610 --> 01:34:19,071
I definitely don't want
to go down there.

931
01:34:19,946 --> 01:34:21,698
The lights should be back on

932
01:34:21,865 --> 01:34:23,575
-in a few hours.
- Thank you.

933
01:34:24,284 --> 01:34:25,786
Chief.

934
01:35:02,656 --> 01:35:03,865
Who is it?

935
01:35:04,324 --> 01:35:06,034
Police, sir.

936
01:35:07,744 --> 01:35:10,038
Do you mind if we come inside?

937
01:35:11,873 --> 01:35:15,919
The police were just here.
They already searched the house.

938
01:35:16,128 --> 01:35:19,464
Another brigade.
It will only be a minute.

939
01:35:21,383 --> 01:35:22,843
Okay.

940
01:35:23,301 --> 01:35:25,095
Sure, come in.

941
01:35:33,019 --> 01:35:35,564
That's the basement.

942
01:35:53,039 --> 01:35:56,209
<i>- Yeah.
- They stole the narcos box, you idiot!</i>

943
01:35:56,376 --> 01:35:57,753
<i>BOX 748.</i>

944
01:35:57,919 --> 01:36:00,297
<i>You're dead if you don't
give back that money.</i>

945
01:36:00,464 --> 01:36:03,300
I know these guys,
I can send them over if you want.

946
01:36:03,800 --> 01:36:05,427
What you're saying
is impossible.

947
01:36:05,844 --> 01:36:07,179
I can't talk to you right now.

948
01:36:07,637 --> 01:36:09,931
Give me time, I'll check it out.

949
01:36:10,098 --> 01:36:13,059
<i>L know you think I'll kill you
so they can't connect you to me.</i>

950
01:36:13,351 --> 01:36:16,396
I can't talk right now,
I'll call you back.

951
01:36:16,563 --> 01:36:17,481
<i>You son of a bitch.</i>

952
01:36:17,647 --> 01:36:19,733
Tell me where you are!

953
01:36:21,651 --> 01:36:22,944
What's wrong?

954
01:36:24,404 --> 01:36:27,073
- Nothing, go to sleep.
- You haven't eaten?

955
01:36:27,824 --> 01:36:30,535
Eat something sweet
or your sugar will be too low.

956
01:36:30,702 --> 01:36:33,246
Tell me.
What happened down there?

957
01:36:37,793 --> 01:36:40,629
Water started coming
from everywhere.

958
01:36:40,796 --> 01:36:42,839
It looks like the floor
caved in

959
01:36:43,006 --> 01:36:44,716
because they were making
a tunnel

960
01:36:44,883 --> 01:36:47,177
to rob the bank next door.

961
01:36:48,178 --> 01:36:51,348
At least that's what
the other policemen said.

962
01:36:53,725 --> 01:36:56,144
Does anyone else live here?

963
01:36:56,853 --> 01:36:58,396
No.

964
01:36:58,814 --> 01:37:00,732
No, not anymore.

965
01:37:01,316 --> 01:37:04,861
Until yesterday there was a girl
with her daughter,

966
01:37:06,071 --> 01:37:09,908
they were renting a room
upstairs with a terrace.

967
01:37:10,367 --> 01:37:11,326
But they left.

968
01:37:12,619 --> 01:37:13,829
They left?

969
01:37:13,995 --> 01:37:15,372
Yeah.

970
01:37:15,622 --> 01:37:16,915
They were...

971
01:37:18,792 --> 01:37:21,503
They were looking for an apartment.

972
01:37:22,379 --> 01:37:24,506
She said they found one.

973
01:37:25,257 --> 01:37:26,591
So...

974
01:37:32,222 --> 01:37:35,225
- Did they leave an address?
- No.

975
01:37:35,684 --> 01:37:36,476
No,

976
01:37:36,643 --> 01:37:38,353
they didn't.

977
01:37:38,645 --> 01:37:42,148
They said they'd be back
for their stuff.

978
01:37:42,315 --> 01:37:45,819
So if you need anything...

979
01:37:47,821 --> 01:37:49,030
Right.

980
01:37:50,282 --> 01:37:52,951
If I ask you for permission
to search the house,

981
01:37:53,118 --> 01:37:54,911
would that be okay?

982
01:37:56,162 --> 01:37:58,331
You're already searching
the basement.

983
01:37:58,498 --> 01:38:02,168
I just want to make sure
that everything's okay.

984
01:38:02,335 --> 01:38:03,962
The police

985
01:38:04,129 --> 01:38:06,548
already searched every room
in the house.

986
01:38:07,632 --> 01:38:08,884
Look...

987
01:38:09,426 --> 01:38:11,845
I think you're right,
there's no need.

988
01:38:14,848 --> 01:38:16,933
So the girl and her daughter
are gone?

989
01:38:17,100 --> 01:38:18,226
No, no.

990
01:38:35,368 --> 01:38:36,745
Let's go.

991
01:38:41,499 --> 01:38:42,667
Berta.

992
01:38:43,251 --> 01:38:45,295
Can you hear me?
Berta.

993
01:38:46,087 --> 01:38:47,505
Berta.

994
01:38:48,632 --> 01:38:49,633
What did you do to her?

995
01:38:49,799 --> 01:38:52,636
Nothing. I didn't do anything.
What's wrong with her?

996
01:38:59,184 --> 01:39:01,102
I think you and I need to talk.

997
01:39:15,492 --> 01:39:16,493
Well?

998
01:39:16,660 --> 01:39:19,120
It looks like the water

999
01:39:19,287 --> 01:39:21,122
made the floor cave in.

1000
01:39:43,895 --> 01:39:46,773
I don't understand what's
happening, officer.

1001
01:39:46,940 --> 01:39:48,858
Can I call you officer?

1002
01:39:52,612 --> 01:39:54,406
Why did you say they had left?

1003
01:39:55,657 --> 01:39:59,411
She told me to say
that they had left.

1004
01:39:59,577 --> 01:40:01,997
And why is she drugged

1005
01:40:02,163 --> 01:40:03,790
with marks from being tied up?

1006
01:40:03,957 --> 01:40:06,459
Marks from being tied up?

1007
01:40:07,335 --> 01:40:09,713
Who would have tied her up?

1008
01:40:09,879 --> 01:40:12,674
- I have no idea.
- That's why I'm asking.

1009
01:40:12,841 --> 01:40:13,591
I don't know.

1010
01:40:14,467 --> 01:40:16,386
Why is she in your bed?

1011
01:40:17,303 --> 01:40:19,222
She wasn't feeling well.

1012
01:40:19,389 --> 01:40:23,018
She took a pill, felt dizzy,
so I said use my bed.

1013
01:40:23,727 --> 01:40:26,354
She couldn't make it upstairs.

1014
01:40:29,691 --> 01:40:31,943
You know this makes no sense.

1015
01:40:32,610 --> 01:40:34,696
But I'm telling you the truth.

1016
01:40:35,780 --> 01:40:37,991
Is the paralysis true
or is that a lie too?

1017
01:40:38,158 --> 01:40:39,451
It's not a lie.

1018
01:40:39,784 --> 01:40:41,828
None of it is a lie.

1019
01:40:43,621 --> 01:40:45,749
When someone tells a lie,

1020
01:40:47,208 --> 01:40:50,086
they have to tell at least
two more to cover it up.

1021
01:40:50,253 --> 01:40:52,839
And then four more
to cover those two.

1022
01:40:53,214 --> 01:40:57,969
You reach a point where
you don't even know how it started.

1023
01:41:06,561 --> 01:41:09,355
Listen to me.

1024
01:41:10,231 --> 01:41:11,483
Please...

1025
01:41:23,203 --> 01:41:24,329
Listen.

1026
01:41:24,996 --> 01:41:27,624
You'd better tell me everything
that happened here.

1027
01:41:30,251 --> 01:41:31,878
I swear I have no idea.

1028
01:41:32,045 --> 01:41:33,296
I have no idea, I swear.

1029
01:41:33,463 --> 01:41:36,174
- Did you see her talk to anyone?
- No.

1030
01:41:50,230 --> 01:41:52,398
It's important for you
to understand something.

1031
01:41:52,565 --> 01:41:53,399
You saw our faces.

1032
01:41:53,566 --> 01:41:55,068
We have to kill you.

1033
01:41:55,235 --> 01:41:57,654
I don't know who you are.

1034
01:41:57,821 --> 01:42:01,157
Right now we are death
personified for you.

1035
01:42:01,366 --> 01:42:02,617
I don't understand.

1036
01:42:02,784 --> 01:42:03,993
I don't understand.

1037
01:42:12,293 --> 01:42:14,170
You only have two options.

1038
01:42:15,380 --> 01:42:18,091
You're in a narrow corridor
with two doors.

1039
01:42:19,008 --> 01:42:21,386
The first door is the one
you've chosen so far:

1040
01:42:21,553 --> 01:42:24,931
Play dumb and stall
to see if that saves you.

1041
01:42:25,431 --> 01:42:28,852
But that door leads to
the worst death

1042
01:42:29,018 --> 01:42:32,105
you can imagine.
Extremely painful.

1043
01:42:32,272 --> 01:42:33,773
You'll watch us hurt you,

1044
01:42:34,315 --> 01:42:35,817
chop you to pieces,

1045
01:42:36,943 --> 01:42:39,529
break your bones,
take out your teeth,

1046
01:42:39,696 --> 01:42:42,991
all very slowly,
with blood everywhere.

1047
01:42:43,700 --> 01:42:45,785
It will surprise you.

1048
01:42:45,952 --> 01:42:50,165
How much your body
can take before you die.

1049
01:42:51,624 --> 01:42:54,502
The second door
is the smart one.

1050
01:42:55,086 --> 01:42:57,088
You talk, tell me
everything you know,

1051
01:42:57,255 --> 01:42:59,465
and you die quickly,
without even realizing.

1052
01:43:00,216 --> 01:43:04,262
It's up to you.
Which door will you choose?

1053
01:43:07,807 --> 01:43:09,517
Put the rag on him.

1054
01:43:09,851 --> 01:43:11,477
No, no...

1055
01:43:11,644 --> 01:43:12,687
So you won't scream.

1056
01:43:12,854 --> 01:43:15,481
Because you're going to,
it's impossible not to.

1057
01:43:27,869 --> 01:43:30,038
Are you sure
you don't want to talk?

1058
01:43:45,428 --> 01:43:46,429
Hello?

1059
01:43:46,596 --> 01:43:49,057
<i>I'm outside your front door.</i>

1060
01:43:53,061 --> 01:43:54,812
Come on in, motherfucker.

1061
01:43:54,979 --> 01:43:57,732
- Help me understand this.
- What's going on?

1062
01:43:57,941 --> 01:44:00,526
What are you doing here?
Are you crazy?

1063
01:44:00,693 --> 01:44:04,030
- Give me back my gun!
- You've got some explaining to do.

1064
01:44:04,239 --> 01:44:05,615
- What are you doing?
- Walk.

1065
01:44:05,782 --> 01:44:06,824
Walk, walk.

1066
01:44:06,991 --> 01:44:08,409
Walk.

1067
01:44:08,576 --> 01:44:11,120
Explain. Why did you call
that cell phone?

1068
01:44:11,287 --> 01:44:15,500
You explain to me.
I have people on the way.

1069
01:44:15,667 --> 01:44:18,211
Explain everything to me!

1070
01:44:20,546 --> 01:44:22,340
Listen closely.

1071
01:44:22,507 --> 01:44:24,884
Where the hell did you get
that cell number?

1072
01:44:25,093 --> 01:44:29,764
That guy sent me a message
saying to come.

1073
01:44:32,433 --> 01:44:33,184
Tie him up.

1074
01:44:33,351 --> 01:44:35,812
No, I'll stay put.
You don't have to tie me up.

1075
01:44:35,979 --> 01:44:38,356
Listen to me.

1076
01:44:38,523 --> 01:44:40,858
In 5 minutes there will be
cops everywhere.

1077
01:44:41,025 --> 01:44:44,320
Yeah, right. And you come
to ring the doorbell first.

1078
01:44:44,487 --> 01:44:45,989
You think I'm fucking stupid?

1079
01:44:46,155 --> 01:44:50,535
Listen to me!
I don't understand this either!

1080
01:44:50,702 --> 01:44:52,537
Don't worry, we're going
to figure it out.

1081
01:44:52,870 --> 01:44:54,247
Look!

1082
01:44:54,414 --> 01:44:56,791
Listen to me, you bastard.

1083
01:44:56,958 --> 01:45:01,379
I don't understand shit here.
Explain this to me.

1084
01:45:01,546 --> 01:45:02,922
Why did he call you?

1085
01:45:03,089 --> 01:45:05,883
I don't know, I swear.

1086
01:45:07,135 --> 01:45:09,345
Bring Berta out here,
she's in his room.

1087
01:45:09,512 --> 01:45:11,723
They have two minutes to talk
or we're gone.

1088
01:45:11,889 --> 01:45:13,766
Put her in his wheelchair.
Guttman!

1089
01:45:14,517 --> 01:45:17,061
Watch. In one minute
you're next.

1090
01:45:17,228 --> 01:45:18,813
No,no,no!

1091
01:45:18,980 --> 01:45:21,941
Don't kill him!
You'll complicate everything!

1092
01:45:22,108 --> 01:45:23,359
Stop, stop!

1093
01:45:23,526 --> 01:45:25,528
Lefty! Lefty! Please!

1094
01:45:25,695 --> 01:45:27,030
Don't let him kill me, Lefty!

1095
01:45:27,196 --> 01:45:28,406
Tell him!

1096
01:45:33,036 --> 01:45:34,746
How does he know your name?

1097
01:45:34,912 --> 01:45:36,080
How should I know?

1098
01:45:38,041 --> 01:45:39,500
Talk!

1099
01:45:41,377 --> 01:45:43,338
Tell him or I will.

1100
01:45:43,796 --> 01:45:45,465
Tell him.

1101
01:45:46,049 --> 01:45:47,383
Please.

1102
01:45:48,217 --> 01:45:52,722
Talk, motherfucker!
How the hell do you know him?

1103
01:45:52,889 --> 01:45:55,266
Please, Lefty. Tell him.

1104
01:45:55,850 --> 01:45:59,062
I have no fucking idea
what he's talking about.

1105
01:45:59,228 --> 01:46:01,105
I don't know him.

1106
01:46:02,065 --> 01:46:04,817
You have 3 seconds
before I blow your head off.

1107
01:46:08,112 --> 01:46:12,575
In the evening...
he'd sneak up to the terrace.

1108
01:46:13,576 --> 01:46:14,786
To see Berta.

1109
01:46:16,079 --> 01:46:17,288
What?

1110
01:46:17,455 --> 01:46:18,790
He told me about the robbery.

1111
01:46:18,956 --> 01:46:21,376
He's making this up!

1112
01:46:21,542 --> 01:46:23,127
Let him talk!

1113
01:46:23,294 --> 01:46:25,463
He and Berta told me
about the robbery.

1114
01:46:26,172 --> 01:46:28,674
About the tunnel.

1115
01:46:28,883 --> 01:46:32,345
He said to make a hole
in my basement

1116
01:46:32,512 --> 01:46:35,056
to grab the money
from the carts.

1117
01:46:35,765 --> 01:46:38,601
We were going to split it
three ways.

1118
01:46:38,768 --> 01:46:41,979
But then you changed
to cat carriers.

1119
01:46:42,146 --> 01:46:44,023
Son of a bitch!

1120
01:46:44,273 --> 01:46:46,442
I told you he was a son of a bitch!

1121
01:46:46,609 --> 01:46:48,236
He's making it all up, I swear!

1122
01:46:48,403 --> 01:46:50,696
I'm making it up?

1123
01:46:51,239 --> 01:46:55,201
He tied up Berta.
He beat her, I don't know why.

1124
01:46:55,410 --> 01:46:57,453
He wanted to keep her asleep.

1125
01:46:57,620 --> 01:47:01,416
He gave me injections
to keep her drugged.

1126
01:47:01,582 --> 01:47:04,502
He didn't trust her
and he was afraid she'd talk.

1127
01:47:04,669 --> 01:47:07,839
You're doing her, is that it?

1128
01:47:10,675 --> 01:47:11,592
Galereto?

1129
01:47:13,094 --> 01:47:14,137
You're Galereto,

1130
01:47:14,679 --> 01:47:16,139
right?

1131
01:47:16,931 --> 01:47:19,058
And you're Canario, right?

1132
01:47:19,350 --> 01:47:22,145
You three are going to hide
in a house in Lomas?

1133
01:47:25,231 --> 01:47:27,108
Nobody else knew about that.

1134
01:47:27,316 --> 01:47:29,861
I have no fucking idea
how he knows that.

1135
01:47:30,111 --> 01:47:32,447
Shut the fuck up
and let him talk!

1136
01:47:35,408 --> 01:47:37,702
Look, there's a key in that drawer.

1137
01:47:38,327 --> 01:47:39,328
Open the door.

1138
01:47:40,163 --> 01:47:41,581
You'll see I'm not lying.

1139
01:48:08,774 --> 01:48:10,860
He left it here.

1140
01:48:22,788 --> 01:48:23,539
Pedro, no!

1141
01:48:24,874 --> 01:48:27,543
No,no,no!

1142
01:48:27,710 --> 01:48:30,296
Pedro, it's okay.

1143
01:48:30,463 --> 01:48:34,425
No,no,no!
It's okay, bro.

1144
01:48:35,593 --> 01:48:37,720
Don't go...

1145
01:48:39,430 --> 01:48:40,932
Don't go...

1146
01:49:20,388 --> 01:49:21,889
Son of a bitch!

1147
01:49:23,224 --> 01:49:24,600
Son of a bitch...

1148
01:49:24,767 --> 01:49:27,395
Fucking bitch!
Fucking bitch!

1149
01:49:44,120 --> 01:49:45,788
Sweetheart...

1150
01:49:45,955 --> 01:49:49,834
I'm sorry, baby. I'm sorry.

1151
01:49:50,001 --> 01:49:52,712
I'm sorry, I'm sorry...

1152
01:49:55,423 --> 01:49:57,717
That's it, it's over.
That's it.

1153
01:50:12,940 --> 01:50:14,191
You need to go.

1154
01:50:14,775 --> 01:50:17,486
Please, get her out of here.

1155
01:50:18,070 --> 01:50:19,572
She needs to get out of here.

1156
01:50:20,489 --> 01:50:22,575
Stay where you are!

1157
01:50:30,541 --> 01:50:31,876
In the end...

1158
01:50:32,585 --> 01:50:35,713
no matter how organized
your plan is,

1159
01:50:35,880 --> 01:50:37,882
it always depends on
either a girl or luck.

1160
01:50:39,300 --> 01:50:41,135
Stop aiming that at me.

1161
01:50:41,302 --> 01:50:44,180
What are you going to do,
bury 4 bodies in the basement?

1162
01:50:46,474 --> 01:50:49,435
So you stole his girlfriend.

1163
01:50:51,145 --> 01:50:53,564
Of course, that's my job,
you know.

1164
01:50:56,484 --> 01:50:58,319
To know everything.

1165
01:51:06,243 --> 01:51:09,205
Scrub the stains
with oxygenated water.

1166
01:51:10,706 --> 01:51:12,917
That's the only thing
that gets the blood out.

1167
01:51:15,503 --> 01:51:16,879
Okay.

1168
01:51:18,464 --> 01:51:21,050
Where's the money you took?

1169
01:51:23,803 --> 01:51:29,058
I take half the money,
and you think about all the things

1170
01:51:29,225 --> 01:51:31,936
I won't do to screw up your life.

1171
01:51:38,192 --> 01:51:39,902
I can screw up your life too.

1172
01:51:49,537 --> 01:51:54,709
<i>These are the safety deposit boxes
you can't touch</i>

1173
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:58,170
<i>because they're connected
to the alarm.</i>

1174
01:51:58,796 --> 01:52:00,381
<i>It's true that after...</i>

1175
01:52:21,610 --> 01:52:24,989
What you've got there only saves you
for the time being.

1176
01:52:26,490 --> 01:52:28,909
The time being, that's all.

1177
01:52:38,252 --> 01:52:40,463
Pick which one goes first.

1178
01:52:51,724 --> 01:52:54,226
The backpack with the money
is right there.

1179
01:53:04,528 --> 01:53:07,239
Erase what you've got there,
trust me.

1180
01:53:09,909 --> 01:53:12,453
Believe me, you can't afford it.

1181
01:53:21,003 --> 01:53:22,713
In the end...

1182
01:53:23,255 --> 01:53:25,257
Like I said before.

1183
01:53:25,716 --> 01:53:29,887
Everything depends on a girl
or luck.
